# M2-Embedded_Hotseat

## About
Now-a-days everyone is looking for automation and advancements in all the sectors that's why i just try to make hotseat for low temperature region.In the hotseat the buttons have to be switched on before the app starts working. Potentiometer acts as temperature sensor. It gives signal which is converted by ADC and used to make a PWM signal pf corresponding duty cycle, as seen in the oscilloscope. As potentiometer is varied, message containing detected temperature is shown in serial monitor. In this project we have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, LED and LCD diplay,etc.
