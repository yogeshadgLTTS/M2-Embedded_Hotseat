# Introduction
## HOTSEAT

The buttons have to be switched on before the app starts working. Potentiometer acts as temperature sensor. It gives signal which is converted by ADC and used to make a PWM signal pf corresponding duty cycle, as seen in the oscilloscope. As potentiometer is varied, message containing detected temperature is shown in serial monitor.
# 4 W's and 1 H

## Who
Every person who wants high temperature and in low temperature region people can be benified.

## What
A Hotseat is a application where one can adjust their requied temperature to the seat to get comfort from the environment temperatures.

## When

Mostly in winter seasons and almost in every regions it can start now.

## Where

It can be implemented in low temperature regions . 

## How

This application was developed in SimulIDE using CodeBlocks. 
# SWOT ANALYSIS
## Strenght
- It is user friendly.
- We can easily change the temperature.
- Cost is low.
- Installation is easy.
## Weakness
- It is applicable for those countries which are having low temperature.
## Opportunity
- it can be implemented by replacing heater by Ac,so that we can use in other countries.
## Threat
- Not sutiable for high temperature places.
